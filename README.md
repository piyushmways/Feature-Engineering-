# Commentry
This Business case centres a logistic Brand in India, which is a fast growing player by revenue. With intentention to improve quality, profitablity and efficiency of their services and Business, Machine Learning models are required to be built.

I have done basic data cleaning & sanitization to get useful features for the model. the core focus in this work is feature engineering to make data readily available to be feed for modelling purpose.

Key Highlights

✨ Defining a clear problem statement
1. Preprocessing of Data
2. Exploratory data Analysis
3. Feature creation and their analysis
4. Outleir detection and handling them
5. Encoding of Catogorical features
6. Feature Scaling
✨ Recommendation based on EDA


✨Key finding
The software used for estimating the time and distance is not giving satisfactory results. Hence there is immediate need to check discrepancies in routing engine and resolution have to be done.
